# Deep-Learning Based Constellation Optimization of Geometric Shaping
## Introduction
An end-to-end BICM system based on NR-LDPC codes, with a DL-based constellation geometry shaping autoencoder for constellation optimization.

Designed a Constellation Rearrangement (CoRe) technique under the Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (HARQ).
